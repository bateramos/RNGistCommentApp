1. To desauthorize the app, you need to enter your password again because we don't store it in any way on the app. The only thing we save from your account is the username and the token generated by Github API to this specific application.

## Development

This application was developed with android in mind at first, but the only code that is platform specific is the use of Android Toolbar on the first page of the APP, making it very easy to adapt to iOS.
To run lint, just run 'npm run lint'
